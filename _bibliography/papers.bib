  abstract          = {Mechanical energy harvesting has increasing scientific and technological interests due to novel energetic challenges. A critical issue in classical cantilever-based mechanical energy harvesting systems is the lack of multidirectional energy conversion capabilities and, due to that, deviations from the excitation source can drastically reduce their performance. This limitation has led to the development of energy harvesters with attached pendula, serving as a direction coupling mechanism. Nevertheless, the pendulum structure itself can act as an energy absorber, drastically reducing the harvester performance in certain scenarios. In order to overcome this issue, a hybrid multidirectional pendulum-based energy harvester has been introduced by the authors. The hybrid transduction integrates a piezoelectric element to capture energy from the principal direction and an electromagnetic transducer to harness rotational energy from the pendulum. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the hybrid multidirectional pendulum-based energy harvester using a nonlinear dynamics perspective to evaluate the energy harvesting performance. A reduced-order model is proposed to represent the essential characteristics of such systems. A parametric analysis using a nonlinear dynamics perspective is carried out to map the system dynamics and performance. The emergence of complex and rich dynamics is observed, including chaos and hyperchaos. Results reveal the most and least effective combinations of structural parameters in terms of energy conversion. Additionally, the dynamical responses and patterns associated with high performance are identified. These responses are often characterized by a blend of irregular complex behaviors, coupled with a mix of oscillatory and rotational patterns of motion, resulting in wider bandwidth systems.},

  abstract          = {This work presents a hybrid multidirectional mechanical energy harvester to enhance the performance of a cantilever-based harvester when subjected to multidirectional excitations. The multidirectional capabilities are achieved by employing a pendulum structure. Hybrid transduction is provided by combining a piezoelectric element and an electromagnetic transducer. A reduced-order model is presented based on the electromechanical Lagrangian formulation, and numerical analyses are performed to characterize the system behavior. A comparison based on energy harvesting performance is established among the novel multidirectional hybrid energy harvester (MHEH), the classical piezoelectric harvester (CPEH), and a multidirectional piezoelectric harvester (MPEH). Results show that the addition of the pendulum alone indeed provides multidirectional capabilities, but the overall performance can be reduced in some scenarios since it works as an energy absorber. This limitation is overcome by the hybridization strategy of the MHEH, by incorporating an electromagnetic transducer into the pendulum support. Overall, a significant improvement is achieved in all scenarios by utilizing the hybrid system.},

  abstract          = {Nature provides abundant ambient mechanical energy in the form of vibration, sound, wave, wind, and biomechanical energy, which can be harvested to power electronic systems. Smart materials-based mechanical energy harvesting systems have attracted increasing attention over the past two decades due to their advantageous characteristics such as high power density, simple design, and scalability. Nevertheless, the design of compact and high-performing systems remains a challenge. This work deals with the analysis of a compact multistable dual-beam nonlinear energy harvester that can be configured for different stability layouts. By using a nonlinear dynamics analysis framework and suitable tools, a qualitative performance characterization of the harvester for each stability configuration is conducted. Results show that multistable characteristics associated with a softer inner beam characteristic and higher excitation levels are related to complex phenomena and can greatly enhance performance.},

  abstract          = {The use of smart materials as transducers in mechanical energy harvesting systems has gained significant attention in recent years. Despite the numerous proposed solutions in the literature, challenges still exist in terms of their implementation within limited spaces while maintaining optimal performance. This paper addresses these challenges through the concepts of compactness and space-efficient design, as well as the incorporation of nonlinear characteristics and additional degrees-of-freedom. A multistable dual beam nonlinear structure featuring two magnetic interactions and two piezoelectric transducers is presented. A reduced order model with 2-degrees-of-freedom is established based on the harvester structure in order to capture the essential qualitative characteristics of the system. Stability analysis demonstrates that the combination of two nonlinear magnetic interactions furnish unprecedented multistable characteristics to this type of harvester. A framework using a nonlinear dynamics perspective is established to analyze multistable systems based on energy harvesting purposes. Different dynamical and stability characteristics are determined by the differences in the system stiffness ratio. Parametric analyses are carried out classifying regions of high performance in the external excitation parameter space. These regions are associated with rich and complex dynamics. Finally, a comprehensive comparison is conducted between the proposed harvester and the classical bistable harvester, revealing improvements in performance across nearly all relevant conditions. These findings highlight the enhanced capabilities of the proposed harvester design, solidifying its potential of application in diverse energy harvesting scenarios.},

For that, four structures are examined, including two recently proposed designs by the authors and two classical devices established in the literature. The NDPF tools effectively map the dynamic and performance characteristics of these harvesters, allowing for a comprehensive comparison between its counterparts.

  abstract          = {Energy harvesting systems play an essential role in contemporary society, and ongoing research in the literature focuses on the development of more efficient designs that allow broader applications. In this regard, one promising approach is the use of hybrid systems that combine multiple transduction mechanisms, such as smart materials, electromagnetic coupling, and triboelectric effect. Another strategy consists of the addition of nonlinear characteristics, which often increase their performance. The source of multidirectionality is another important aspect that still remains a challenging topic. Therefore, the concept and performance of a nonlinear energy harvester that deals with hybrid transduction and multidirectionality is a challenging topic that needs to be investigated. This investigation addresses these challenges by incorporating a pendulum structure in a conventional cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvester to enable multidirectional capabilities. A generic prototype model is presented to study the main characteristics of this type of system. The performance of the device is addressed and compared to its classical linear cantilever-based counterpart.

  abstract          = {The recent developments in technology and the emergence of Industry 4.0 have been motivating the study of optimized systems and new solutions to improve the employment of networks that use components as self-powered sensors, actuators and small electronic devices. In this regard, the scavenging of wasted forms of energy dissipated in the ambient is a topic that has been receiving great attention during the last few decades, especially the vibration energy. Composite structures utilizing piezoelectric materials are often employed to convert available mechanical energy into electrical energy exploiting the direct piezoelectric effect. In this work, a nonlinear two-degree of freedom Duffing-type energy harvesting system is proposed to enhance the performance of conventional devices. A discrete model is developed and numerical simulations are presented addressing the advantages and disadvantages of the system. Results show large operation bandwidths and power outputs, specially in higher frequencies.},

  abstract          = {Recent developments in technology requires the employment of self-powered sensors, actuators and small electronic devices. Energy harvesting systems are useful to this goal and can be configured in many different ways to improve process efficiency. The converted energy can also be stored to be further consumed. Mechanical vibration is one of the energy sources that can be converted into electrical energy. Besides the energy harvested, it is possible to mitigate undesirable vibrations. Smart materials are usually employed in these systems in order to promote electro-mechanical conversion. Piezoelectrics are smart materials employed to several applications in industry. Nonlinear characteristics are usually exploited in order to enhance energy harvesting capacity. In this regard, multistable energy potential is usually exploited by adding magnetic interactions to the system, being described by a Duffing-type system. Duffing oscillator has a rich dynamical behavior including chaos. In this regard, nonlinear dynamics analysis is essential for a proper design of the energy harvesting system. An important issue to be investigated is the correlation between energy harvesting capacity and the kind of response, which makes essential the use of proper nonlinear tools for a deep dynamical analysis. This paper addresses the correlation between the maximum Lyapunov exponent and power harvesting parameters in order to define harvesting capacity. Among the possibilities to be investigated, it should be highlighted the output RMS power and the efficiency of the energy conversion. This analysis allows one to connect the degree of chaoticity, represented by the value of Lyapunov exponents, with the electro-mechanical conversion efficiency.},

  abstract          = {Recently, the study of the conversion of vibrational energy into electrical power has become an important field of research for clean and renewable energy resources. That concept has been improved on smart material field, due the last decade technological achievements on piezoelectric materials. Further, several low power devices as sensor and actuators were developed, so the energy harvesting through piezoelectric materials excited by environmental vibrations become a potential energy source on engineering. However, researchers still face challenges for the low energy efficiency of those conventional devices. The bistable energy harvesting devices have drawn significant attention due to some of their unique features, that method may enhance those devices efficiencies. This paper investigates a piezomagnetoelastic systems that consists of a permanent magnet fixed to the end of a piezoelectric cantilever which interacts with another magnet placed close to the free end of the cantilever, when the system is subjected to a harmonic base excitation. The magnets generate nonlinear repulsive force and make the structure bistable. The nonlinear energy harvester responds to vibration with large tip deflections and high energy orbit oscillations. Thus, the system can exhibit a broadened frequency response and sometimes chaotic motion, enhancing its energy harvesting potential.},
