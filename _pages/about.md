Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and a Professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([COPPE/UFRJ](https://coppe.ufrj.br)), affiliated with the Center for Nonlinear Mechanics ([Mecanon](http://mecanon.coppe.ufrj.br)). In addition, I hold both M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees also in mechanical engineering.

My current research is associated with nonlinear phenomena, including energy harvesting, smart materials and structures, nonlinear dynamics, multistability, and chaos. My expertise is complemented by a solid background in HPC, allowing me to tackle complex problems with precision and efficiency.

You can contact me via e-mail, researchgate or linkedin.
