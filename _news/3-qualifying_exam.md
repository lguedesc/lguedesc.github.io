Today marked a significant milestone as I defended my qualifying exam on the path to obtaining my PhD. The topic is on the analysis of energy harvesters using a nonlinear dynamics perspective. I'm very grateful for the insightful feedback and constructive criticism received from my esteemed evaluators. Excited for the next steps in this academic journey!
