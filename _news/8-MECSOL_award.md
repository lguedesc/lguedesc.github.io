I'm deeply honored to share that our paper entitled "Mechanical Energy Multi-Harvesting: On the Performance Enhancement of Mechanical Energy Harvesters" received the [ABCM](https://abcm.org.br) Best Paper Award at the 9th International Symposium on Solid Mechanics (MECSOL 2024)!

The conference tool place at the lovely and relaxing campus of [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br), in Florian√≥polis ‚Äî one of the most remarkable cities in southern Brazil.

The awarded work discusses and exemplifies an effective design framework for producing mechanical energy harvesters with enhanced harvesting capabilities.

I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor [Marcelo Savi](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=efTbXygAAAAJ&hl=en) for his invaluable guidance, to the symposium organizers for promoting such a rich and stimulating environment for knowledge exchange, and to everyone who supported and encouraged me throughout this process.

This recognition inspires me to further explore innovative approaches in energy harvesting and nonlinear mechanics.
