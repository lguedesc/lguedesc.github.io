This week I had the opportunity to attend DINAME 2025, and what an amazing event! 🔥

DINAME always offers a unique, fully immersive format, bringing together top researches in the field of dynamics. This edition took place in Águas de Lindóia (SP) - Brazil, and it was an incredible opportunity to exchange ideas, learn, and build valuable connections.

I had the pleasure of presenting my work "Nonlinear Dynamics Perspective Framework Employed to the Analysis of Energy Harvesters", which is a key part of my recently defended Ph.D. thesis. It was truly rewarding to share this research and receive insightful feedback.

Already looking forward for DINAME 2027, which will be held in the Amazon! 🍃
